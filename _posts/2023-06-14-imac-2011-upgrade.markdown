### Why Upgrade

The 2011 iMac can't be upgraded to MacOS 10.14 Mojave (or higher) because the stock GPU it has doesn't support Metal. The last, officially supported non-Metal MacOS for the 2011 iMac is 10.13 High Sierra.[^12]

Mojave, however, is needed for Apple Logic Pro X 10.5[^13], and I was collaborating with some folks who created projects using it. This requires swapping the GPU with one that supports Metal and then installing the OS with custom patches.[^19]

Since I'm already performing surgery on the computer, I might as well upgrade the CPU as well. Music production can be particularly CPU intensive, especially when using software instruments or synths.[^14]

### But Why DIY

The simplest route would have been to purchase a new machine that supported Mojave. However the DIY appealed to me for a few reasons:

* Less cost üí∞
* Less e-waste ‚ôªÔ∏è
* Fun, new challenge (haven't done something like this before) üîß
* Good trailblazing by the community ü§ì
* Sentimental üñ•Ô∏è
* Artistic üë®üèΩ‚Äçüé®

### iMac Specs

Both the CPU and GPU will be upgraded.

* CPU upgrade for added performance
* GPU upgrade for Metal acceleration, enabling MacOS 10.14 Mojave and greater

Stock machine:

* Mid 2011 27" iMac 12,2
* A1312 EMC 2429
* 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5 (i5-2500S) with Turbo Boost 3.7 GHz
* AMD Radeon HD 6770M 512 MB
* Full OEM specs listed on [Everymac](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/specs/imac-core-i5-2.7-27-inch-aluminum-mid-2011-thunderbolt-specs.html)

In addition, some previous upgrades were:

* 32 GB DDR3-1333 RAM
* Dual Drive (via extra SATA port[^7], still retains optical drive)
	* 256 GB Samsung 840 PRO Series SATA III 6 Gbps
	* 1 TB 7200 RPM WDC WD1001FALS-403AA0 SATA II 3 Gbps

### New Parts

* Intel Core i7-2600 CPU ($80 eBay)
* Nvidia Quadro K610M 1024 MB ($22 eBay)
* Artic Silver Combo Kit for CPU/GPU dies ($15)
* K5 PRO Thermal Paste for GPU VRAM ($11)

#### CPU Old vs. New

Here is the original CPU the iMac came with.

* 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5 (i5-2500S) with Turbo Boost 3.7 GHz ([link](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/52211/intel-core-i52500s-processor-6m-cache-up-to-3-70-ghz/specifications.html))

The CPU I chose was offered in 2011 as an Apple-supported upgrade, making it a plug-in replacement.[^3] It uses the same [Sandy Bridge architecture and the LGA 1155 socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Bridge#Desktop_platform) as the original.

*  3.4 GHz Intel Core i7 (i7-2600) with Turbo Boost 3.8 GHz ([link](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/52213/intel-core-i72600-processor-8m-cache-up-to-3-80-ghz/specifications.html))

It's now known (since my original research in 2019) that [Sandy Bridge Xeon chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Sandy_Bridge-based_Xeon_microprocessors#Sandy_Bridge_Xeon) also work, so another option could have been the 1290.

* 3.6 GHz Intel Xeon E3-1290 with Turbo Boost 4.0 GHz and 8 MB L3 Cache ([link](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/55452/intel-xeon-processor-e31290-8m-cache-3-60-ghz.html))

#### GPU Old vs. New

The old GPU is from AMD and does not support Metal.

* AMD Radeon HD 6770M 512 MB

The new GPU is from a Dell/Alienware laptop.

* Nvidia Quadro K610M 1024 MB (MXM-A form factor)

Note: the K610M is the least powerful upgrade, but it is the most straightforward[^9] without requiring any heatsink[^6] or temperature sensor[^8] modifications. Since this machine will primarily be used for audio production (rather than video), a simple GPU card is OK.

#### Sourcing the Parts

Finding a CPU on eBay was easy. GPUs on the other hand were reported to be hit/miss.

Luckily my K610M from eBay worked the first time!

### Outline

The [MacintoshMen upgrade guide](http://macintoshmen.is-great.net/2019/09/08/imac-2009-to-2011-upgrade-guide/) is an excellent starting point for reviewing available CPU and GPU options. Community support is chiefly found on two Mac Rumors pages: *CPU Upgrade iMac Mid 2011*[^1] and *2011 iMac Graphics Card Upgrade*[^2].

Some of these steps (like upgrading to High Sierra) could be rearranged earlier, but here is what I did.

1. Open the iMac and get to the motherboard
2. Physically install the new CPU
3. Reboot, confirm it still works
4. Upgrade to High Sierra and confirm latest Mac firmware is present
5. Prepare GPU vBIOS USB boot drive
6. Open the iMac again
7. Physically install the new GPU that supports Metal
8. Built-in screen no longer works üò±
9. Turn on the iMac and flash the new GPU vBIOS using another computer and SSH
10. Built-in screen works again ü•≥ but brightness control and sleep won't work yet üòÖ
11. Use OpenCore[^15] to restore native keyboard brightness control[^17] and sleep functionality
12. Install Mojave, since now the iMac supports Metal ü•≥

### Performing the Upgrade

#### I. CPU Install

1. Follow steps 1-32 of the iFixit guide [Installing iMac Intel 27" EMC 2429 Dual Drive Kit (HDD or SSD)](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Installing+iMac+Intel+27-Inch+EMC+2429+Dual+Drive+Kit+(HDD+or+SSD)/7575)
2. Follow steps 43-end of the iFixit guide [iMac Intel 21.5" EMC 2428 CPU Replacement](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iMac+Intel+21.5-Inch+EMC+2428+CPU+Replacement/5951) (it's the same for the 27")
3. Release the CPU and seat the new one.
4. Apply Thermal Paste to the CPU, consulting the [Artic Silver guide](http://www.arcticsilver.com/intel_application_method.html) for reference. Note: the i7-2600 is 2nd generation and therefore needs a **single vertical line**.

6. Reboot success! (I was running Sierra at the time) ![]({% asset "imac-Screen Shot 2020-06-02 at 10.26.42 PM.png" @path %}) 

#### II. High Sierra

1. The new GPU will need OpenCore to restore native keyboard brightness control. OpenCore in turn requires the latest MacOS firmware, so first make sure the computer has it.[^11]
2. Upgrade the iMac boot rom firmware to the latest version by installing High Sierra on an internal disk, including all recent Apple software updates.
3. Confirm the firmware version is up to date using the Eclectic Light Company's firmware lookup table.[^16]
4. Open System Preferences and enable High Sierra for remote access, screen sharing and remote login (SSH) just in case after the GPU replacement the display remains black!

#### III. Preparing the vBIOS

vBIOS stands for video BIOS. Most of the aftermarket GPUs come from Dell/Alienware laptops, so they need to be re-flashed. Without this, the iMac boots to a nice, black screen.

There are a few options for flashing the new vBIOS, but the easiest, non-Windows way is via SSH and a USB flash drive.[^4]

Note: I did this back in June 2020, and since then there is an updated USB image (`Mac_GPU_Flash.zip` md5 `7d9e19926da009f2565597542089360d`) with different instructions.[^5] The original steps I followed (`2011_imac_usb.zip` md5 `18e02e92844ebed8fc0fcf3ca039c754`) are still present, just with strikethroughs. I followed Q3 in the old FAQ. 

![]({% asset "imac-vbios-Screen Shot 2020-12-21 at 3.55.20 AM.png" @path %})

1. Download the file `2011_imac_usb.zip` (md5 `18e02e92844ebed8fc0fcf3ca039c754`) for the USB image from [here](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2011-imac-graphics-card-upgrade.1596614/page-175?post=28184981#post-28184981)
2. Download the K610M vBIOS from [here](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2011-imac-graphics-card-upgrade.1596614/page-271?post=28497093#post-28497093) to **restore the display and show the boot picker**[^10]
3. Use Disk Utility to format the USB drive with GPT + FAT32. Copy the files to the new flash drive, no Etcher etc. required. Also copy the vBIOS file onto there afterwards.
4. Unplug and keep this USB ready for later.

#### IV. GPU Install

A nice summary of the process is here <https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2011-imac-graphics-card-upgrade.1596614/page-596?post=29967927#post-29967927>.

1. Follow the CPU removal guide to get to the GPU.
2. Apply the GPU thermal paste. The K610M has one die and four VRAM chips. Use the same kind of thermal paste for the die as for the CPU (Artic Silver), but use the goopier thermal paste for the four VRAM chips (K5 PRO).
3. GPU is same dimensions as the original so pop it back in.
4. DO NOT fully put the computer back together yet (see next step).

2. Applying all required thermal paste/compounds ![]({% asset imac-gpu-2.jpg @path %})

#### V. GPU vBIOS Flash

Instructions for this section are stitched together partly from the OP[^4] but also from the new GMRL flash GitHub page.[^18]

4. The iMac should still be half open. Disconnect any SATA hard drive cables on the iMac. This makes it easier to load from the USB!
5. Connect the iMac ethernet port to your router‚Äîno wireless connections!!
6. Plug the USB flash drive from Part III into the iMac, and turn it on. The screen will be black, but it would have booted into the USB drive.
7. Lookup the DHCP IP of the iMac by checking your router, etc.
8. Find another computer/Mac and SSH into iMac. `ssh root@YOURIP` and password `flash`
9. Find/change into the working directory `cd /lib/live/mount/medium/flash`
10. (Optional) Backup the old vBIOS `./nvflash --save Backups/OldNVBios.rom`
10. Remove the guard rails `./nvflash --protectoff`
11. Write the new ROM to the vBIOS `./nvflash -6 NVIDIA/NewNVBIOS.rom`
12. (Optional) Verify it worked `./nvflash -6 NVIDIA/NewNVBIOS.rom`
10. Reboot and enjoy the monitor again!

![]({% asset "imac-vbios-Screen Shot 2020-12-21 at 3.58.45 AM.png" @path %})

Note: after the vBIOS flash, the monitor will always be at full brightness until OpenCore kicks in. This means even after OpenCore patches are applied to the boot EFI, entering Recovery Mode or the like will have the iMac display at full brightness.

1. Need the monitor to work again, so using another machine initiate an SSH-based nvflash ![]({% asset "imac-vbios-Screen Shot 2020-06-09 at 12.44.26 AM.png" @path %})) ![]({% asset "imac-vbios-Screen Shot 2020-06-09 at 12.44.41 AM.png" @path %})
2. Flash success, ignore the warnings ![]({% asset "imac-vbios-Screen Shot 2020-06-09 at 12.45.41 AM.png" @path %})
3. Internal screen is working again! ![]({% asset "imac-vbios-IMG_1618.jpg" @path %})

#### VI. Installing OpenCore

Next we install OpenCore via OpenCore Legacy Patcher (OCLP). From the WikiPost:

> After installing OpenCore your system will be qualified to run the stock installer programs provided by Apple.

> Owners of NVIDIA/AMD cards with a working EFI Boot screen can install the EFI folder directly to the EFI partition of the internal disk (process described in the OCLP docs). Having an EFI Boot screen one can always boot without OpenCore just by pressing alt/option on boot and selecting a supported macOS version like High Sierra.

> Please do not change any of default values (like SIP). You will only break the installation. The tool auto-detects hardware and will auto-configure the optimal OpenCore settings.

> History:
Catalina Loader (CL) was another solution based on OpenCore to be installed on USB or SD devices and maintained more easily on visible file systems than on hidden EFI partitions. The solution was helpful in times without an EFI boot picker. Since we now fully support EFI boot with all AMD cards there is no need for this out of date solution.

Note: if you are currently running Catalina Loader, building and installing OpenCore Legacy Patcher can be done afterwards too to replace the USB dongle boot.

#### VII. Upgrading to Mojave

Previous techniques required patching the MacOS installer using dosdude (what I did in 2020). However with OCLP, no customization is needed to the MacOS installer anymore!

2. Stairstep upgrade from High Sierra to Mojave for the final state! ![]({% asset "imac-Screen Shot 2020-06-11 at 10.02.13 AM.png" @path %})
