### Gear

#### Hardware
* [2007 MacBook Pro 2,2](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-2-duo-2.16-15-specs.html)
  * 15.4" Matte Screen
  * 2.16 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
  * ATI Radeon X1600 128 MB
  * Sold on 9/2015. Firewire ports starting acting buggy when recording (overheating issue), SSD compatibility was also limited
* [2012 MacBook Pro 9,1](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.6-15-mid-2012-unibody-usb3-specs.html)
  * 15.4" Matte Screen
  * 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7
  * NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1024 MB
  * 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 RAM
  * [1TB Samsung 840 EVO SSD](http://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/MZ-7TE1T0BW)
  * Only limitation of this guy is 1 thunderbolt port
* [2014 MacBookAir6,2](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook-air/specs/macbook-air-core-i7-1.7-13-early-2014-specs.html)
  * 13.3" Screen
  * 1.7 GHz Intel Core i7
  * Intel HD Graphics 5000
  * (2) USB 3.0, (1) Thunderbolt, (1) SD Card, Headphone Out
* Sony HDR-FX7 HDV camera
  * 15' Firewire cable to record to disk rather than MiniDV tapes
* [Sony FDR-AX100 4K camera](http://www.sony.com/electronics/handycam-camcorders/fdr-ax100)
  * Only limitation is the inability to pipe 4K via HDMI _while_ recording to SD card, so have to switch to HD when doing live stream + recording. However, it shouldn't matter because in 4K mode the camera doesn't zoom in as far as in 1080 modeâ€”it's using the same sensor.
* [JuicedLink CX231]
  * To input mic/line level XLR inputs into either camera as a 3.5" mic input
* [Blackmagic UltraStudio Mini Recorder Thunderbolt](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/ultrastudiothunderbolt/techspecs/W-DLUS-04)
  * Used as HDMI input for live streams. Thunderbolt endpoint, cannot daisy chain (maybe some technical limitation?)
* Blackmagic Intensity Pro Shuttle USB 3.0
  * Can also be used as HDMI input for live streams. Provides additional composite and component input for capturing from older VHS tapes, etc. for archiving footage
* [Manfrotto 190XPROB Tripod](https://www.amazon.com/Manfrotto-190XPROB-3-Section-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B000N7VPRW)
* [Manfrotto 290 Tripod MT294A3](https://www.manfrotto.us/294-aluminum-3-section-tripod)
  * This newer tripod is slightly longer/taller than the 190XPROB and doesn't normally fit in a carry-on while traveling whereas the 190XPROB does.
* Manfrotto 701HDV Fluid Head
* Manfrotto MVH502AH Fluid Head
* (2) Manfrotto LANC Remote Adapter MVR901EPLA To 701HDV Head (custom eBay)
* (2) Manfrotto 519LV Telescoping Pan Handle
* (1) Manfrotto 502HLV Pan Bar
* PNY Elite Performance Class 10, 95 MB/s SD Cards: (2) 128 GB, (2) 64 GB (for XAVC-S video)
* Transcend 32 GB SD card (came with Sony AX100 but not fast enough for XAVC-S)
* Samson S-convert -10dBV to +4dBu Converter
  * Perfect for plugging laptop/iPhone sound into a mic send
* (4) Harrison FMOD 12dB Inline RCA Attenuator 900087
  * These RCA attenuators are vital for recording off prosumer -10dB REC/TAPE OUT feeds from the mixer. Otherwise, transients in the 0-12dB range on the mixer will not have enough headroom to record
* (2) Monoprice Premium 2 RCA M/M 22AWG Cable 15' (max suggested cable run is 30 meters)
