### Freelance Videographer @ UMD

In 2010, I slowly began sneaking my camera over to the music wing to film my friends' recitals. This is how I first learned to:

* Record directly to disk via Firewire
* Render to the DVD format
* Program DVD menus
* Design album covers, labels, etc.
* Employ basic color correction techniques
* Sync to professionally mastered audio

#### Karl Wiederwohl
Video recording, audio syncing, and editing.

This particular one has fond memories. Filmed inside the UMD Physics Lecture Halls after hours. Tripod and camera were on a dolley with wheels and I as cameraman slowly tried to pan in time with the music!

#### Livestreaming for DESI

My inauguration to livestreaming came at the request of a cultural program by an Indian student organization. It was a simple setup to YouTube via a firewire port.

It was also my great fortune to meet Debu Nayak and Soumya Chakraverty, who performed a sarod and tabla recital for the program. They asked me for a copy of the recording aftewards and then I found Chhandayan!

#### 2009 - Physics Question of the Week

Summer 2009. This is where I first learned to use a real video camera, a [Canon XL2](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/339002-REG/Canon_9549A001_XL2_MiniDV_Camcorder.html){:target="_blank"} with DV output. I took pictures and filmed experiments for the *Physics Question of the Week* with Dr. Richard Berg, from question [#348](https://lecdem.physics.umd.edu/images/ArchivedWebsite/outreach/QOTW/arch18/q348.htm){:target="_blank"} to [#366](https://lecdem.physics.umd.edu/images/ArchivedWebsite/outreach/QOTW/active/q366.htm){:target="_blank"}. (Dr. Berg was getting ready to retire, so some of the latter puzzles were also contributed by myself!)

#### 2010 - Physics Colloquia

After filming experiments, I started taping weekly colloquia. The speakers ranged from visiting professors, to Nobel laureates, to our own faculty. Some of these talks have been published publicly by permission of the speaker.

Through these talks, I learned:

- The importance of recording audio from a microphone/mixer directly
- How to sync audio to video in post
- The importance of balanced audio and how radio signals are picked up in long runs
- How to denoise audio and its limits
- How to use and edit with two cameras

January 26, 2010. Econophysics talk by my statistical mechanics professor, Victor Yakovenko.

The two-camera rig consists of one [Sony HDR-FX7 HDV](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/459129-REG/Sony_HDRFX7_HDR_FX7_3CMOS_HDV_1080i.html){:target="_blank"} camera actively keeping the speaker in the lower right corner of the shot, while another static camera (the older Canon XL2) films the projector screen itself.

In post, the second camera is cropped and overlayed picture-in-picture with a little transparency. This way, the green laser pointer is captured and preserved in realtime, infinitely increasing the value for the viewer! Audio of course captured from the back mixer and synced afterwards, and title slide edited by myself.

Dr. Yakovenko was later recognized an interviewed by New Economic Thinking in 2013 ([video](https://youtu.be/aBxjrAjrIZY){:target="blank"}) for his research in econophysics.

November 16, 2010. Distinguished Scholar-Teacher Lecture by Professor Bill Dorland.

This was the first times I started nuancing the editing process further by overlaying the powerpoint slides when appropriate, mixing ambient audio to best salvage the audience's spontaneous unmiked questions, and using the same picture-in-picture effect when the laser pointer was busted out.

#### 2010 - Joint Quantum Institute News Outreach

Here, I helped edit for the news and outreach wing under Mr. Curt Suplee. It was my first introduction to Adobe Premiere, since his custom rig was based on Windows. It was the first time I saw a 1080i HDV camera, the [Sony HDR-FX7 HDV](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/459129-REG/Sony_HDRFX7_HDR_FX7_3CMOS_HDV_1080i.html){:target="_blank"}, which a later bought used.


Intro to basic audio recording and editing for a podcast called *The Quantum Wire*.

#### 2011 - Digital Conversion

Tasked with the digitization of a two DVD set of *Demonstrations in Acoustics* using H.264. Created title slides in Apple Motion for the first time.
