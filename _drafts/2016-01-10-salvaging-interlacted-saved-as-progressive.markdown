title:  "Repairing Interlaced Footage Saved as Progressive"

We'll start with a quote from Larry Jordan:

> X.264 and H.264 should only be used when creating files for the web. If you plan to edit the resulting file, convert it to ProRes instead. AVCHD files compressed into H.264 for editing will look just awful.

Oops.

### The Rub
i made the mistake once (alright, two times) of recording HDV 1080i interlaced footage as progressive H.264. In an attempt to save on disk space and not use those awful MiniDV tapes, i had the brilliant idea of automatically saving to disk. ScopeBox always came to the rescue.

The only hiccup this time was: the same camera was to be used for livestreaming. It wasn't possible to share the video source with both Wirecast and ScopeBox, so i thought, "Hey, why not try recording straight to disk in Wirecast instead?"

Since HDV is technically a 4:3 1440x1080 image that's then stretched out, i wasn't sure whether i should record to 1920x1080 or 1440x1080. So instead, i said, let's just do H.264!

One major downside regardless, which i now realize, is Wirecast won't save timecode.

Rather than "upscale" to 1920x1080, i thought going 720p would be betterâ€”less loss of quality.

Thus the Nightmare Before the 2013 All-Night Concert began.
