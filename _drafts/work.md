### Indian Classical Concerts

Over the years I've had the great fortune to record for some extremely notable artists of Indian classical music.

#### Soumya Chakraverty and Debu Nayak

#### Buddhadev DasGupta

#### Anirban DasGupta and Debu Nayak

#### Shahid Parvez and Anindo Chatterjee



### Chhandayan Center for Indian Music (2011 - Present)

#### Media Archival

Digitized over 20 years and 10 TB of concert footage from MiniDV tapes, 8mm tapes, VHS tapes, and other outdated media. Content mirrored locally on a Synology NAS and archived remotely on Backblaze B2 cloud storage.

#### All-Night Concert Videographer

Responsible for multicam filming, editing, and live-streaming the annual All-Night Concert in NYC.

### Freelance Student Videographer @ UMD (2010-2011)

In 2010, I slowly began sneaking my camera over to the music wing to film my friends' recitals. This is how I first learned to:

* Create professional DVDs
* Program DVD menus
* Design and print disc labels
* Employ basic color correction techniques
* Sync video to professionally mastered audio
* Record directly to disk via Firewire

#### Karl Wiederwohl
Video recording, audio syncing, and editing.

This particular one has fond memories. Filmed inside the UMD Physics Lecture Halls after hours. Tripod and camera were on a dolley with wheels and I as cameraman slowly tried to pan in time with the music!

#### Daniel Sender

#### Adelphi String Quartet

#### Livestreaming

My inauguration to livestreaming came at the request of an Indian student organization, DESI. It was a simple livestream setup using a single camera fed to a laptop via firewire and cast to YouTube.

It was also my great fortune to meet Debu Nayak and Soumya Chakraverty, who performed a sarod and tabla recital for the program. They asked me for a copy of the recording aftewards and then I found Chhandayan!

### UMD Physics Department (2009 - 2011)

#### DVD Conversion

Fall 2011. Digitized 29 videos from a two DVD set of *Demonstrations in Acoustics* using H.264. Created title slides in Apple Motion for the first time. These are still up on Vimeo on the [UMD Physics](https://vimeo.com/umdphysics){:target="blank"} page (have to scroll down a bit).

#### Joint Quantum Institute

Summer 2010. Here, I helped edit for the news and outreach wing under Mr. Curt Suplee. He formerly worked with the Washington Post so our work was interview-based. It was my first introduction to Adobe Premiere, since his custom rig was based on Windows. It was also the first time I saw a 1080i HDV camera, the [Sony HDR-FX7 HDV](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/459129-REG/Sony_HDRFX7_HDR_FX7_3CMOS_HDV_1080i.html){:target="_blank"}, which I later bought used.

As a media person, I also begain basic audio recording/editing for a podcast called *The Quantum Wire*.

#### Physics Colloquia

Spring and Fall 2010. After filming experiments, I started taping weekly colloquia. The speakers ranged from visiting professors, to Nobel laureates, to our own faculty. Some of these talks have been published publicly by permission of the speaker.

Through these talks, I learned:

- The importance of recording audio from a microphone/mixer directly
- How to sync audio to video in post
- The importance of balanced audio and how radio signals are picked up in long runs
- How to denoise audio and its limits
- How to record and edit with two cameras by myself

*January 26, 2010. Econophysics talk by statistical mechanics professor, Victor Yakovenko.*

This two-camera rig consists of one [Sony HDR-FX7 HDV](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/459129-REG/Sony_HDRFX7_HDR_FX7_3CMOS_HDV_1080i.html){:target="_blank"} camera actively keeping the speaker in the lower right corner of the shot, while another static camera (the older Canon XL2) films the projector screen itself.

In post, the second camera is cropped and overlayed picture-in-picture with a little transparency. This way, the green laser pointer is captured and preserved in realtime, infinitely increasing the value for the viewer! Audio is captured from the back mixer and synced afterwards, and the title slide was edited by myself.

Dr. Yakovenko was later recognized an interviewed by New Economic Thinking in 2013 ([video](https://youtu.be/aBxjrAjrIZY){:target="blank"}) for his research in econophysics.

*November 16, 2010. Distinguished Scholar-Teacher Lecture by Professor Bill Dorland.*

This was the first time I nuanced the editing process further by overlaying original powerpoint slides where appropriate, and mixing ambient camera audio to salvage the audience's spontaneous unmiked questions. I used the same picture-in-picture effect when the laser pointer was used.

#### Physics Question of the Week

Summer 2009. This is where I first learned to use a real video camera, a [Canon XL2](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/339002-REG/Canon_9549A001_XL2_MiniDV_Camcorder.html){:target="_blank"} with DV output. I took pictures and filmed experiments for the *Physics Question of the Week* with Dr. Richard Berg, from question [#348](https://lecdem.physics.umd.edu/images/ArchivedWebsite/outreach/QOTW/arch18/q348.htm){:target="_blank"} to [#366](https://lecdem.physics.umd.edu/images/ArchivedWebsite/outreach/QOTW/active/q366.htm){:target="_blank"}. (Dr. Berg was getting ready to retire, so some of the latter puzzles were also contributed by myself.)
